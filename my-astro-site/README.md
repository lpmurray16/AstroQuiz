# A Simple Harry Potter Quiz App

## Made using Astro and React

A simple quiz app that uses the [Astro](https://www.astro.build/) framework which is REALLY an awesome tool.
You can use any front-end framework/library you want within an Astro project (React, Svelte, Vue, etc.). But the neat thing is you can use them all at the SAME time within the same page.
It is a very useful and easy templating framework focused on using minimal Javascript.

I used [React](https://reactjs.org/) to build the functionality of the quiz itself.
